# Async Oracle pipeline (option B) — WIP

Resumable, background-friendly network analysis so a large network (up to ~10k
contacts) can be analyzed in bounded chunks instead of one synchronous
browser-driven run that blows past every 60s serverless limit.

**Status: first cut — needs live testing against Supabase + Mistral.** The
synchronous pipeline on `main` is untouched and remains the default; this is an
additive, opt-in path ("Gros réseau" button).

## How it works

State lives in two tables (`supabase/migrations/20260720090000_add_analysis_jobs.sql`):

- `analysis_jobs` — one row per run: `status`, `phase`, progress counters,
  carried context (userProfile, bridge/locked), and the final `synthesis` /
  `supply_demand`.
- `analysis_job_batches` — one row per MAP batch, written when that batch's
  result is computed (small independent writes, no giant blob rewrite).

The orchestrator `api/oracle/job.ts` is a state machine. Each `advance` call
does ONE bounded slice and persists it, so no single invocation risks a 504:

1. **embed** — warm the embedding cache in waves of `EMBED_WAVE` (250) contacts
   by calling `topology` in `embedOnly` mode. Repeats until nothing is left to
   embed. (This is why fresh 10k embedding no longer 504s.)
2. **plan** — call `topology` normally (embeddings now warm → fast); persist the
   batch definitions. Batches with an inline cached MAP result start `done`.
3. **map** — run `MAP_WAVE` (6) pending batches per advance via `map-batch`;
   store each result and mark it done.
4. **reduce** — synthesize via `reduce`. **Single pass over the richest
   `MAX_REDUCE_BATCHES` (80).**
5. **supply** — build the offre/demande matrix via `supply-demand`.

It REUSES the existing endpoints (topology/map-batch/reduce/supply-demand) over
internal HTTP, forwarding the caller's JWT — no logic duplicated except the
topology `embedOnly`/`maxAnalyze` modes it added.

The client (`src/lib/oracleJob.ts`) creates a job then loops `advance` until
done, reporting progress. Because all state is in Supabase, the loop is
**resumable**: close the tab, reopen, call `runAnalysisJob(jobId)` to continue.

## Before it works, you must

1. **Apply the migration** (`20260720090000_add_analysis_jobs.sql`).
2. Test on a real large network and watch the phases advance.

## Known limitations / next steps

- **Hierarchical reduce.** REDUCE currently feeds only the richest 80 batches to
  a single reduce call. A true 10k (hundreds of batches) needs partial reduces
  per group of batches, then a final reduce of the partials — otherwise the tail
  of the network never reaches the synthesis. This is the main follow-up.
- **Autonomous background (cron).** Today the job advances only while a tab
  drives it (it IS resumable on return, but not fully unattended). A Vercel cron
  that pushes stale-`heartbeat_at` running jobs forward needs a service-role
  auth path in the endpoints, because a cron has no user JWT for RLS on
  `contacts`. Deferred deliberately rather than shipped broken.
- **Client memory.** `App.tsx` still loads all contacts client-side (paginated)
  with a 15s timeout — fine for the pipeline (which is server-side) but the rest
  of the app holding 10k contacts in memory is a separate concern.
- The `map` phase runs its wave's batches sequentially inside one advance; if a
  wave itself approaches 60s under heavy rate-limiting, lower `MAP_WAVE`.
